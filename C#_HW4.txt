1. Describe the problem generics address.
Generics solve the problem of type safety and code reuse when working with collections of data,
allowing us to design classes or methods but defer the specification of types until the class or method is declared and called

2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
List<string> arr = new List<string>();

3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
2.

4. True/False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
True.

5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
List.Add()

6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
List.clear(); List.remove().

7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
A generic type is declared by specifying a type parameter in an angle brackets after a type name, e.g. TypeName<T> where T is a type parameter.

8. True/False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
False.

9. True/False. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
True.

10. True/False. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
True.
